Eighty-five-year-old Harikrishna Kaila from Swamikartik Rural Municipality-4 is an example in Bajura of the struggles faced by individuals in the hilly and mountainous areas of Karnali and Sudurpaschim when trying to access healthcare services.

On August 7, Kaila experienced diarrhea at his house. At first, his family attempted home remedies, however, the diarrhea persisted. After two days of receiving care at home with no signs of getting better, Ajbir had to carry his father for two hours in the morning to reach a road accessible by vehicles on Bhadra 9. They then arranged for a car to transport him to Kolti.

'When treatments at home did not work for my father, I brought him to Kolti airport to go to Nepalgunj,' Ajbir explained. 'Even after two days, the plane did not arrive.'

When it became impossible to fly his father to a major city hospital, he decided to reserve an ambulance to take him to Surkhet instead. The Karnali Highway extends from Bajura to Humla. He was taking his father to Surkhet along the same route. During the monsoon season, traveling by road to Surkhet is not easy. On the 11th, he reserved an ambulance costing 20,000 rupees to transport his father from Bajura to Surkhet. The ambulance had to stop overnight since they couldn't cross the Fugad River in Kalikot. 'The diarrhoea persisted, and my father hadn't eaten,' he explained. 'I brought him in an ambulance, determined to bring him to the hospital even if it meant staying overnight, but we had to stop because the water level in the Fugad River had risen.

After the water level declined the next morning, they tried again to cross the Fugad River but were once again stopped on the Karnali Highway. Landslides had blocked the road at several points from Tijeghada in Kalikot to Khidkijyula in Dailekh. The flood had also carried away the concrete bridge that connected Kalikot across the Dahikhola.

Not only had the flight disappointed Kaila, but the road did too.‘As long as there is life, there is hope,’ he said. ‘I decided to carry him across the landslide-blocked roads with the help of people.’ "From Jiteghada to Khidkijyula, I carried him myself in some places and hired porters in others," he explained. It took six hours to travel from Jiteghada to Khidkijyula. From there, I reserved another vehicle and eventually brought my father to Surkhet.

It took Ajbir six days to bring his sick father from their home in Bajura to Karnali Province Hospital in Surkhet.

"'It's really difficult for people like us living in the mountains and hills to receive medical treatment,' Ajbir, who was met at Karnali Province Hospital in Surkhet on Saturday, stated. 'The transportation expenditures are even more costly than the treatment itself.' He also reported that it cost about 65,000 rupees to transport his father from their house to Surkhet. 'It took six days to get from home to Kolti and then from Kolti to Surkhet,' he explained. 'During this period, I had to reserve an ambulance and a Bolero separately, as well as pay the porters who transported us. Overall, 65,000 rupees were spent only on transportation. He stated that his father's health had improved and that he was discharged from the hospital on Saturday. While the transportation cost 65,000 rupees, the procedure itself cost only 3,000 rupees.

The doctor advised Kaila to return in a week. They have no relatives in Surkhet who can assist them with food and accommodation. After being discharged, Ajbir stated that he would take his father to Kailali. 'The money we borrowed has been spent on the journey,' he explained. 'Staying in a hotel would be extremely costly, so we will stay at a relative's home in Kailali instead.'
