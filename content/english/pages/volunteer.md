Embark on a meaningful journey to Nepal and make a lasting impact by volunteering at an age care home. Joining our community provides a unique opportunity to connect with elderly individuals, immerse yourself in the local culture, and contribute to the well-being of the residents.	

As a volunteer, you will have the chance to engage with the elderly residents, sharing your skills and experiences while learning from theirs. Whether it's assisting with daily activities, leading therapeutic sessions, or fostering social interactions, your time and effort will contribute significantly to the quality of life for the residents.	

As part of our sustainability efforts, volunteers are expected to cover the cost of their stay.
