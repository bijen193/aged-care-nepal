Dr. Prabhat Adhikari is a physician, entrepreneur, and healthcare reform activist with a keen interest in medical IT and research. During his super-specialization in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care in the USA, he had an epiphany about the dire need to revolutionize the healthcare system in third-world countries by leveraging cutting-edge technologies. Afterward, he collaborated with his colleagues to establish Danphe Care, a multinational company aimed at creating cutting-edge medical software that incorporates a Hospital Management System (HMS), Telemedicine, and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) on a global scale. This turned out to be a turning point in his career, and he decided to return home to pursue his dream.

Dr. Adhikari is also the founder and CEO of the Center for American Medical Specialists (CAMS) in Nepal, a super-specialty medical clinic established to deliver evidence-based ethical practices in Nepal's healthcare system. CAMS is led by American Board-certified medical specialists and focuses on infectious diseases, travel medicine, hematology, oncology, pediatrics, and preventive medicine. The clinic is working on groundbreaking healthcare technologies, advanced laboratory services, an outpatient infusion center, and patient-centric precision medical services.

Furthermore, Dr. Adhikari is an exceptional leader in Nepgen, a Contract Research Organization (CRO) that is fully dedicated to conducting clinical research, offering extensive training to its workforce, and developing state-of-the-art electronic databases.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Adhikari and his remarkable team bore witness to the truly alarming emergency in the provision of vital medical services and equipment, encompassing everything from life-saving medicines and vaccines to essential diagnostics. This led to the establishment of Novala Biotech Pvt. Ltd., a company dedicated to bringing in sophisticated technologies from around the world to address the existing problem in the supply of medical diagnostics in Nepal.

Dr. Adhikari is also fulfilling his social responsibilities through ASK Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free access to healthcare for people in rural areas of Nepal through telemedicine, health camps, and the construction of hospitals.
